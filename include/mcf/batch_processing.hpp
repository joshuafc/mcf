/***
 * This class implements a multi-object trajectory solver that processes the
 * sequence in batches. For this purpose, the class mimics the interface of
 * the Graph class to build a flow network incrementally. Similar to the solver
 * interface, trajectories can be optimized using RunSearch().
 *
 * Internally, the class caches the solution obtained from RunSearch() to build
 * the set of trajectories incrementally, without solving over the entire
 * sequence at each call. On construction, a minimum optimization window length
 * can be specified.
 *
 * Exemplary use-cases
 * -------------------
 *
 * * To divide the sequence into fixed batches of 100 frames each, set the
 *   constructor's window_len parameter to 100 and call RunSearch() every
 *   100 frames.
 * * To estimate trajectories in an on-line fashion, call RunSearch() at each
 *   time step (after calling FinalizeTimeStep()). Set the constructor's
 *   window_len parameter to the history of time steps that should be optimized
 *   (similar to N-back-scan pruning in multiple hypothesis tracking).
 * * As alternative, call ComputeTrajectories() and RemoveInactiveTracks() at
 *   each time step (after a call to FinalizeTimeStep()) to only keep track of
 *   objects that are within the optimization window_len. This prevents the
 *   number of trajectories in the cache from growing unbounded.
